## Our Story

Founded in the UK, Hey Mello (Mello AI Ltd) was born from a simple observation: businesses struggle to provide consistent, high-quality customer service at scale. Traditional call centers face challenges with staffing, training, and managing fluctuating call volumes, while customers expect instant, personalized support around the clock.

We set out to solve this problem by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to create voice agents that sound natural, understand context, and handle complex conversations with the empathy and intelligence of your best human agents.
